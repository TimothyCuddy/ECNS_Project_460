# ECNS_Project_460

## Stage 1: Plan
### 1. Agree on a topic for your project with your partner. It can be anything relevant to economics, public policy, or business, but you should both find it interesting! Your topic should be new to you – don’t use the same topic any of your team members have used for another class.
      Tempurature Data at location's across the United States, which can be useful in showing trends in climate change 

### 2. Make a broad plan for the Analysis/Product stage. Read the instructions for Stage 3 below and agree on a tentative plan for what you’re going to do for the Analysis/Product (you can change it later). If you’re going to do an Analysis, write down your research question and the type of analysis you’re planning to conduct. If you’re going to build a Product, write down your goal, intended audience, and what you are thinking of producing.
    (Option A) Analysis: Answer a research question. Start by finalizing a well-defined research question that your data can help you answer. Here are a few examples of good research       questions:
        (Descriptive) Has wealth inequality increased in the U.S. faster than in Europe since 2000?
        (Causal) Does receiving Medicaid coverage reduce the risk of bankruptcy?
        (Predictve) Can nighttime satellite imagery be used as a real-time indicator of economic activity?
        *tempurature data could connect to a ton of different things, I think an analysis would be the most interesting way to take this. Handling that in a way that connects to the location would also be really interesting. How does more warming in your area affect X? Which we could do in a way that finds a different value based on multiple nearby datapoints. This would probably take a lot of effort to figure out, but not to much to expand after that*

    (Option B) Product: Build something new. Alternatively, you can create an product that makes it easier for other people to ask and answer their own questions using your data. Start     with a well-defined goal and intended audience, and then go try to achieve that goal. Here are a few products I can imagine; you may think of others:
        *I think it could be interesting, but would probaby require more total busy work*

### 3. Decide on a challenge to undertake. Choose a new tool (or more than one!) that you would like to teach yourself on your own and use in your project. It should be related to the tools we are covering in this course, but clearly different, and it must be new to both team members. You can implement the challenge in either the Visualization or the Analysis/Product stage of the project, or both. If you choose to build a Product, your challenge might be the same thing as the product. Here are some possible challenges; you may think of others:
    Spatial Analysis

### 4. Find data from at least two different sources that are related to your topic. Download them and make sure you’re going to able to use them for analysis. The datasets should relate to each other in some way that will allow you to join (merge) them together, but you don’t have to do that yet. All data you use should be publicly available and come from the original (primary) source. They should not be pre-cleaned, which would prevent you from getting experience processing the data. No datasets we’ve used in class, datasets that get automatically loaded in R packages, or datasets posted on Kaggle or similar repositories.
    Tempurature Data - *where from?*
    Some characteristic about the locations? IPUMS + Location? 

### 5. Create a public repository on GitHub for your project. (You can always make your repo private after the semester if you prefer, but past projects on your GitHub account will look great to future employers.) Add a document that describes your topic, your tentative Analysis/Product plan, and the challenge you are choosing. Then, describe your datasets. Include the source URL, what kind of variables are contained in each dataset (no need for a full list), the timespan and spatial coverage of the datasets, and how the datasets are related to each other.


(Option A) Analysis: Answer a research question. Start by finalizing a well-defined research question that your data can help you answer. Here are a few examples of good research questions:
  (Descriptive) Has wealth inequality increased in the U.S. faster than in Europe since 2000?
  (Causal) Does receiving Medicaid coverage reduce the risk of bankruptcy?
  (Predictve) Can nighttime satellite imagery be used as a real-time indicator of economic activity?

(Option B) Product: Build something new. Alternatively, you can create an product that makes it easier for other people to ask and answer their own questions using your data. Start with a well-defined goal and intended audience, and then go try to achieve that goal. Here are a few products I can imagine; you may think of others:



Visualization (40 points).
  Style, coding practices, file organization.
  Data wrangling and cleaning (demonstration of skills and principles).
  Visualizations (demonstration of skills and principles).
  Effectiveness and interpretation.
Analysis (40 points).
  Effectiveness (goal is well-defined, chosen tools are appropriate, goal is met).
  Demonstration of analytical skills from this course (show me what can you do).
  Appropriate use of chosen tools (getting the details right and making good judgments).
  Communication (writing is clear, document is professional)
Challenge (10+ points).
  Demonstrated use of tools beyond the course material.
Presentation (10 points).
  Slides and delivery.

An “A” grade means your project exceeds expectations. It:
  Demonstrates a wide range of skills covered in this course.
  Carefully follows best practices from nearly all topics in this course.
  Challenges yourself in a meaningful way (i.e., you went beyond the assignment minimum expectations).
A “B” grade means your project meets expectations. It fulfills the requirements and shows a range of skills from this course. It may not precisely follow every best practice but gets   the job done.
A “C” grade means your project meets some expectations but has problems or omissions that limit its effectiveness. A typical student probably could have submitted most of it before  taking this course.
